## Cyclistic Bike-Share Usage Analysis

Cyclistic, Chicago’s public bike-share program, aims to increase annual memberships, which generate more predictable and profitable revenue than one-off casual rides. To support this goal, I analyzed trip data from Q1 2019 and Q1 2020 to understand how casual riders and annual members use the system differently. The goal was to identify behavioral patterns that could inform targeted marketing strategies for converting casual users into members.

The analysis reveals a clear divide between the two types of riders. Members account for over ten times more trips than casual riders, and their usage is highly consistent across weekdays, strongly suggesting regular commuting behavior. In contrast, casual riders take significantly fewer rides, but their trips last nearly three times longer. Casual usage peaks on weekends, aligning with recreational outings, tourism, and leisure-based travel. Casual riders also show noticeable spikes in trip duration on Wednesdays and weekends, indicating flexible, non-commute-driven patterns.

These insights show that casual riders are not opposed to cycling—they simply use the service differently and are motivated by different needs. Their behaviors reveal a major opportunity: Cyclistic can convert a portion of these leisure-oriented riders into paying members by offering membership options and incentives that align with how they already ride.

capitalize on this, I recommend three targeted strategies:

A weekend-focused or leisure-oriented membership tier,

In-app price comparison prompts showing casual riders how a membership would reduce their long-ride costs.

Digital marketing campaigns activated around high-casual-usage times and locations, and

Together, these approaches align directly with observed behaviors and have strong potential to convert casual users into annual members while preserving the value members already receive.
